# SR-FloW-Net: Multimodal Self-Supervised Image Super-resolution and Registration for Remote Sensing Imagery

## Overview

SR-FloW-Net is a deep learning model designed for the registration of multispectral images. This model aligns images taken from different spectral bands, enabling accurate and efficient analysis of multispectral data. The SR-FloW-Net architecture leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn complex spatial transformations and align images with high precision.

## Features

- **End-to-End Training**: Train the model from scratch with your multispectral datasets.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieve precise alignment of images across different spectral bands.
- **Flexible Architecture**: Easily adaptable to various multispectral imaging applications.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed instructions and examples for easy implementation and customization.
